# Super-Duo

This project was built for the Android Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity. Added enhancements to two apps in order to make them production ready. The work included ensuring errors were handled gracefully, building a widget for the home screen, support for screen readers, optimizations for localization, and barcode scanning via a library.

For football scores:
Go to http://api.football-data.org/register
to get a free api key and place it in myFetchService.java
where it says "Your-Api-Key" in the getData method.
